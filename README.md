# EduSenseNet: Behavior-Aware Transformer for Moral-Education Fusion Effect Evaluation in Physical Education Contexts

EduSenseNet is a behavior-aware transformer framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of moral-education fusion in physical education (PE) environments. The system addresses the need for advanced computational models capable of interpreting the dynamic, multimodal, and socially embedded nature of physical education.

## Overview

Traditional computational approaches often struggle to capture the temporal evolution of skills, peer interactions, and the nuances of moral learning in PE. EduSenseNet overcomes these challenges by integrating:

- Domain-adaptive deep learning to handle varied educational settings  
- Attention-based reasoning to model spatiotemporal behavior  
- Symbolic representations to align analysis with pedagogical objectives

The framework processes asynchronous, multimodal inputs—including textual logs, visual movement data, and structured records—to provide a holistic evaluation of student engagement and behavior.

## Core Components

- KinGraph Encoder Network (KGEN): Extracts graph-based motion and coordination features  
- Adaptive Curriculum Synchronization Strategy (ACSS): Aligns behavioral modeling with curriculum goals  
- Neural-symbolic fusion module: Enables interpretable, adaptable analysis  
- Time-aware modeling: Supports cross-session continuity and moral growth tracking

## Applications

- Behavioral assessment in physical education  
- Monitoring moral and cooperative learning outcomes  
- Curriculum-aligned learning analytics and feedback systems  
- Interdisciplinary research in education and human behavior

## Future Work

- Release of source code and pretrained models  
- Demo interface and synthetic dataset samples  
- Documentation and usage tutorials
